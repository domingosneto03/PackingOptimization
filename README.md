# Packing Optimization
This project focuses on solving a variation of the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, applied to delivery logistics. The objective is to maximize profit by selecting the optimal combination of pallets to load onto a delivery truck without exceeding its weight capacity.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Exhaustive Search: explores all possible combinations to find the optimal solution.
- Dynamic Programming: optimizes performance using memoization for overlapping subproblems.
- Greedy Approximation: selects pallets based on profit-to-weight ratio (non-optimal but fast).
- Linear Integer Programming (LIP): formulates the problem using constraints and solves it optimally.
